        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are committed to seeing to that no pet goes unloved and unadopted in our community.
            For over 30 years we have been hard at work putting animals who are in need in a good home. 
            If you are considering adopting feel free to check out our contact us page.The pandemics restrictions on social gathering has made
             it difficult to socialize which could lead to depression. There is no better way to socialize at home than with a pet. Pets are loyal companions that will stand by your side in these trying times with a smile on their face. Adopt one today!
